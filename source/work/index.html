        <h3>VRChat</h3>
        <h4>Senior Software Engineer / DevOps, March 2018 – June 2024</h4>
        <p>
            Scaled VRChat from a meme to a community of millions. As a very
            early employee, in a flat to no-hierarchy organization, I've
            created or worked on nearly every backend system, often
            coordinating with other teams to deliver features. VRChat has
            to process millions of user-submitted 3D assets and that was
            my focus area for the last few years – architecting, coding and
            deploying the backends of our big swing projects. I usually
            also delivered the web UI for my own features, and it was often
            praised for its usability. As a side project, dramatically
            simplified our test code and reduced time-to-deploy from almost
            an hour to minutes.
