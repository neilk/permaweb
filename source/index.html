            Hi. I’m one of the luckiest people you’re likely to meet. I’ve gotten to travel and live in
            many different places, to seriously try my hand at many things, and to encounter and befriend so
            many interesting people.
        </p>
        <p>
            Code has been my vocation for decades now and there are some things I’ve done that I’m proud of,
            particularly open source work in cryptography and internationalization. Over my career, a theme
            has emerged of helping people create and collaborate at large scale. I also greatly enjoy creating maps
            and other visualizations to get an overview effect of what humanity is up to.
        </p>
        <p>
            At other times, I’ve gotten obsessed with design, typography, music, journalism,
            activism, bicycling, running, and cooking.
        </p>
        <p>About 10 years ago I met the love of my life and
            I’m planning to be obsessed with her forever. We live in Vancouver, Canada.
